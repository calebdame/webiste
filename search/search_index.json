I have a dad who works in animation, a mom who went back to school 15 years ago to be a nurse, an older brother doing a PhD in Planetary Science, three younger sisters, and an amazing wife. When I was 18, I left my home to serve a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Northern France.  I still take every opportunity to use my French, even if its listening to Harry Potter audiobook in French.</p> <p>When I got back, I attended Brigham Young University in Utah, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, mostly because I was good at Math in high school, I did not quite know what I wanted to do, and applying Math sounded a lot more interesting than not applying it.  I graduated after 4 years, and while I was there I learned that programming was fun, I got married, and I taught French 101 for 2.5 years.</p> <p>I now am the proud owner of an English Bulldog Puppy \"Bear\", and in my free time I work on the types of things you'll see on this sight: work at the intersection of Statistics, Economics, Machine Learning, Fun code, and creating random things on a computer.</p> <p>Thanks for visiting, Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or on Github</p>"},{"location":"clustering/","title":"Tweet Generation","text":"<p>For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.</p>"},{"location":"clustering/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> -

In order to get reliable and unbiased confidence intervals for estimates in statistical models, there can be too many features, and we can bias the model by including the wrong features.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to algorithmically and consistently decide which features to include in a test for NYPD Racial Discrimination, I detail below in a paper how to use a Post-Double Selection LASSO model to choose parameters.  After discarding all features obviously not relevant to the question of discrimination (meaning that we kept only information known by the officer before the stop), correctly using two different LASSO models can further weed out confounding erroneous factors that could deeply bias results.  </p> <p>The final model finds the likelihood of firearms or drugs on the person stopped, and finds that being black decreases the likelihood of possession. This implies that Blacks were not only stopped in a higher proportion to their share of the population, but that the police were not completely justified for the stops since they were less successful by their stop-rates in finding contraband among Blacks than among any other racial subpopulation.</p> <p>Read more in depth or download it here</p>"},{"location":"papers/#a-survey-in-time-series-weather-prediction-models","title":"A Survey in Time-Series Weather Prediction Models","text":"<p>The canonical prediction question has always been predicting the weather: inherently random, with predictable elements we can still consider.
